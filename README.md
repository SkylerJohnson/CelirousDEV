What is CelirousDEV?
CelirousDEV is a server emulator for the popular F2P MMORPG, MapleStory.
It is currently being developed by Skyler Johnson and Stephan Inox. Based on a Clean MetroMS, we have unlocked maximum potential
of a java-based(Odin) source. We have used the maximum potential of not using computer-memory. NPCs and features are being added daily
to enhance gameplay for players enjoyment.
We hope that you enjoy CelirousDEV.
